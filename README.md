# Portfolio
This is a remake of my portfolio with Gatsby and Contentful. I wanted to move away from markdown files to a full blown CMS with Contentful. There was a slight performance hit, but I am more than happy with my decision otherwise. 

# Technologies Used
- React with Gatsby
- Contentful CMS
- Netlify for hosting
